				<p>Takumi Fujiwara is the son of the legendary street racer, Bunta Fujiwara.  In spite of such a fine pedigree, he has no real interest in racing at first.  In fact, he states that he hates driving.  At the age of 13 his father had him start making deliveries for his business, running up and down Akina mountain to deliver tofu to the hotel at the top.  At the same time, he started to train his driving skills.  One way he did this was by putting a cup of water in his cup holder, telling him he couldn't spill a drop.  If he managed to do so, the tofu would arrive unharmed.  Of course, it also helped his driving ability, as he was forced to learn how to drive smoothly, to avoid damaging his precious cargo, and quickly, to make sure he wasn't up all night doing tofu runs.  After 5 years of doing this, he has become the most skilled downhill driver in Akina, surpassed only by his father.  Aside from this late night driving and incredible skill, he also works at the Esso gas station since his dad doesn't pay him for his work.</p>
				<p>Normally a reserved individual, Takumi is one of those people whose friends come to them, rather than the other way around.  He also has a strong sense of justice, and a dislike for people who don't share those same feelings.  Intelligence wise, he isn't what one would call book smart, but he has more than enough intuition and determination to brute force his way through any challenges life throws at him.</p>

			<h2>The White Ghost of Akina</h2>
			<img src="img/86.png" style="width: 500px;">
			<p><i>Takumi's 86</i></p>
			<p>Takumi drives his father's Zenki model Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX, or simply, the AE86.  By all accounts an old car, but in spite of this he has made it work as he was thrust into the street racing world.  Few things can compensate for skill and good driving sense, which Takumi has in spades.  Not only this, but with the 86's light weight and punchy 1.6 liter 4A-GE inline 4, it's perfectly suited for the downhill racing that he is experienced in.  This combination has allowed him to come out on top in every battle he's fought.  Unfortunately though, the car is beginning to show it's age, especially as Takumi encounters racers of increasing skill, driving cars of increasing speed and maneuverability, leaving him to barely eek out a victory at times.</p>

			<h2>His Friends and Family</h2>
			<!-- about Bunta -->
			<div>
				<h3>Bunta Fujiwara</h3>
				<img src="img/bunta.png" style="width: 250px;">
				<p>Takumi's father, legendary street racer, and chain smoker.  He is not the greatest example of a father by any stretch of the imagination, and he largely leaves Takumi to his devices, as long as he handles his deliveries.  He set fastest downhill record in his 86, which has yet to be broken even as the cars the local racers use have gotten better and better.  Though he doesn't drive much now, he's still widely considered to be the fastest downhill racer in Akina.</p>

				<!-- about Itsuki -->
				<h3>Itsuki Takeuchi</h3>
				<div>
					<img src="img/itsuki.png" style="height: 250px;">
					<p>Takumi's best friend and coworker at the Esso gas station, they first met in middle school.  Ever since then, they've been inseparable, though it's likely because he won't stop following Takumi everywhere and putting his nose in his business.  Personality wise, he's very noisy and obnoxious, but his friends tolerate it.  In fact, these traits actually had a part in him successfully convincing Takumi to give racing a try.  After being inspired by his amazing driving, he decided to get an AE86 of his own.  Unfortunately, he didn't go to anyone for help with this task, and accidentally bought an AE85 instead.  A vastly inferior car to the AE86, the AE85 has a weaker engine, weaker brakes, softer suspension, and much less chassis bracing.  However, after Takumi gives it a spin himself with Itsuki in the passenger seat, and shows him that a skilled driver can make even a weak car work, he began to practice often in hopes of following Takumi's foot steps.</p>

				<!-- about Iketani and Kenji -->
				<h3>Iketani and Kenji</h3>
				<div>
					<img src="img/iketaniandkenji.png" style="width: 250px;">
					<p>Childhood friends, and the best drivers in the Akina Speedstars.  Iketani, who drives an S13, works at Esso gas station with Takumi and Itsuki, and played a large part in getting Takumi interested in street racing.  At first, he was utterly shocked by Takumi's unparalleled skill, but he's come to accept it, and relies a lot on Takumi to protect their home turf from hostile racers bent on topping the Speedstars' records.  Although he doesn't work with them, Kenji visits the gas station in his 180SX often to discuss cars and upcoming races with the rest of the group.</p>

			<!-- about Natsuki -->
			<div>
				<h3>Natsuki Mogi</h3>
				<img src="img/natsuki.png" style="width: 250px;">
				<p>Takumi's pseudo-girlfriend, she originally avoided speaking to Takumi after he beat up her then boyfriend.  After hearing that he did so because of the way he spoke about her, she decided to get closer to him, and it slowly progressed into a relationship.  There's some other stuff, but I'd prefer not to write about that right now.</p>

			<h2>His Many Battles</h2>
			<!-- Keisuke -->
			<h3>Versus Keisuke Takahashi and his RX-7 FD</h3>
			<p>Technically 2 races, the first being when Takumi was on a tofu delivery run down Akina and began (most likely by accident) an improptu battle with Keisuke.  Takumi passed him, to the shock of Keisuke, and later completely lost him after using a scandinavian flick, or inertia drift.  The second battle was when Keisuke, knowing he had to prove that he could beat some old junker from the 80s, indirectly challenged Takumi to a battle.</p>
			<img src="img/keisuke.png" style="width: 250px;">
			<!-- Takeshi -->
			<h3>Versus Takeshi Nakazato and his R32</h3>
			<p>He fights Takeshi.  No one believes he will win, but at the five-hairpin section of the Akina downhill, as Takeshi's R32's front tires begin to lose grip, turns in and takes the inside line, passing Takeshi.  As he's passing, Takeshi loses his cool and pushes his car to hard, causing it to spin out and crash.</p>
			<img src="img/placeholder.png" style="width: 250px;">
			<!-- Shingo -->
			<h3>Versus Shingo Shoji and his EG6</h3>
			<p>At first Takumi decided not to accept Shingo's duct-tape deathmatch challenge, but after Shingo causes Itsuki to crash, thinking it was actually him, Takumi decides he can't back down.  Throughout the battle Shingo continually toys with Takumi, staying just behind him, but pulling ahead once to show he could pass him whenever he wants. At first, Takumi struggles with the tape, at one point nearly crashing as well as almost breaking his hand.  Despite this, he soon gets the hang of it, noticing that he can go through corners faster if he uses the steering less.  Slowly but surely Shingo notices that Takumi is not going to give in to the pressure, and decides to end things where they were by causing Takumi to crash.  He pulls in closer and hits his bumper, causing him to spin out, but Takumi manages to pull out of the spin, not far behind Shingo.  Shingo chalks it up to good luck, but Takumi is furious, saying there's no way he could lose to scum like Shingo.</p>

			<!-- Blue Impact -->
			<h3>Versus Mako and Sato, known as "Blue Impact", and their Sileighty</h3>
			<p>They race, Blue Impact spins out after Mako pushes the car too far during a turn, and Takumi narrowly avoids her car.</p>
			<img src="img/placeholder.png" style="width: 250px;">
			<!-- Kenta -->
			<h3>Versus Kenta Nakamura and his S14</h3>
			<p>Since it had started raining towards the latter half of Keisuke and Takeshi's up-hill battle on Myogi mountain, Kenta, who drove in the rain often to save money on tires, decided that this was his chance to try and defeat Takumi.  In spite of believing he was superior in the rain, Takumi quickly overtakes Kenta.</p>
			<img src="img/placeholder.png" style="width: 250px;">
			<!-- Ryosuke -->
			<h3>Versus Ryosuke Takahashi and his RX-7 FC</h3>
			<p>The battle that everyone had been waiting for, inbetween Takumi Fujiwara and Ryosuke Takahashi, Keisuke's older brother.  Ryosuke loses.</p>
